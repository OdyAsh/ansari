/**
 * Sentry: how this service tells an operator about a fault.
 *
 * Python counterpart: the `sentry_sdk.init(...)` block at the top of `app/main.py` and the `set_tag` / `set_context` /
 * `capture_exception` calls spread through the services. Here the services only know the small `ErrorReporter` function
 * (`errorReporter.ts`); `sentryReporter` below is the one that really sends.
 *
 * The scrubbing follows `apps/auth/src/alerts.ts`, which has the reasoning and a test that proves it. Sentry's request-data
 * integration attaches the in-flight request (headers, cookies, query string, body) to every event raised while that request
 * is handled, and `sendDefaultPii: false` covers neither bodies nor the `Authorization` header. A webhook body carries the
 * sender's BSUID, phone number and message text, and the handshake's query string carries the verify token, so every event
 * keeps only the request's method, path and a few harmless headers.
 *
 * Differences from Python:
 * - Python also sampled traces and profiles (20% in production). Not ported: a trace records each request's URL, and the
 *   handshake URL holds the verify token. Error reporting is what the service used Sentry for.
 * - Python filtered out log events containing "HTTP exception: 401" and "403", which its Sentry logging integration would
 *   otherwise have sent. Nothing here sends log lines to Sentry, so there is nothing to filter.

# Plan: Translate the WhatsApp service to TypeScript

**Specification**: [codev/specs/358-whatsapp-typescript.md](../specs/358-whatsapp-typescript.md)

## Executive Summary

A new app, `apps/whatsapp`, re-implements the Python service in `legacy/whatsapp` with the same externally visible behaviour. `legacy/whatsapp` stays untouched as the behavioural reference until staging is verified (spec: no production migration in this issue).

The Python tests (197) are the oracle: each phase ports one layer bottom-up, together with the tests for that layer, so every phase ends green and nothing is written without a test that can fail.

### Stack, chosen to match `apps/auth` (the closest sibling)

| Concern | Choice | Python counterpart | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| Runtime | Node.js >= 22.18 | CPython 3.13 | Same engine as `apps/auth`; `engines` and the Docker base image are already settled |
| HTTP framework | Express 5 | FastAPI | Already used by `apps/auth`; small, well known |
| Runtime validation | Zod 4 | Pydantic | Already used by `apps/api` and `packages/auth` |
| Outbound HTTP | Node's built-in `fetch` | httpx | No extra dependency; supports streamed bodies |
| Tests | Vitest | pytest | Same as every other app |
| Dev / build | `tsx` / `tsdown` | `uvicorn` / none | Same as `apps/auth` |
| Errors | `@sentry/node` | `sentry-sdk` | Same as `apps/auth` |
| Logging | Small in-app JSON logger with the masking rules ported from `log_masking.py` | loguru + `log_masking.py` | Masking is behaviour we must keep exactly; a library would not remove that work |
| Markdown to WhatsApp text | Port the 99-line formatter by hand | `whatsapp_message_formatter.py` | Exact output must match the Python tests; a library would change it |

### TypeScript notes for the reader (Python to TypeScript)

- **Types vanish at runtime.** `type Foo = {...}` is checked by the compiler, then erased. A JSON body from Meta is `unknown` until a Zod schema parses it. This is the TypeScript counterpart of a Pydantic model, with one difference: Pydantic validates automatically, Zod only when you call `.parse()`/`.safeParse()`.
- **`async`/`await` and Promises.** Same keywords as Python, but a Promise starts running immediately when created (a Python coroutine does not run until awaited). The "answer Meta 200 first, then process" pattern is therefore just `res.sendStatus(200)` followed by an un-awaited call whose failures we catch ourselves: an un-awaited Promise that rejects crashes or goes unnoticed, so every background task gets a top-level `.catch` that logs and reports to Sentry.
- **Streams.** `fetch` returns `response.body`, a web `ReadableStream` of byte chunks. We read it with `for await`, decode with `TextDecoder` (chunk boundaries can split a multi-byte character, so decode with `{stream: true}`), then apply the same aggregation as the Python client.
- **Modules.** `package.json` has `"type": "module"`, so files use `import`/`export` (not `require`). Local imports end in `.ts`/`.js` according to the repo's tsconfig; follow `apps/auth`.
- **`null` vs `undefined`.** Both mean "no value"; JSON only has `null`. The code uses `undefined` for "absent" and `null` only when a wire format says so.
- **Config.** There is no Pydantic `BaseSettings`; a Zod schema parses `process.env` once at startup and exports a frozen object. All values arrive as strings, so booleans and numbers need explicit parsing (`"False"` is a truthy string).
- **Dependency injection.** FastAPI uses `Depends`; here the services are plain objects created in one `buildApp(deps)` function, so tests pass mock clients instead of patching modules (the base/real/mock trio becomes one interface plus a real and a mock implementation).

## Phases (Machine Readable)

```json
{
  "phases": [
    {"id": "phase_1", "title": "Scaffold apps/whatsapp, config, masked logging"},
    {"id": "phase_2", "title": "Pure logic: formatter, splitter, webhook parser, language and time helpers"},
    {"id": "phase_3", "title": "Service clients: apps/auth exchange, apps/api streaming, Meta API"},
    {"id": "phase_4", "title": "Conversation manager"},
    {"id": "phase_5", "title": "HTTP app: webhook verification, signature check, immediate 200"},
    {"id": "phase_6", "title": "Docker, Railway config, CI, turbo and documentation"},
    {"id": "phase_7", "title": "Operator script port, staging redeploy, smoke test and legacy rollback note"}
  ]
}
```

**The green command for every phase**, run from the worktree root: `pnpm --filter ansari-whatsapp test && pnpm --filter ansari-whatsapp typecheck && pnpm --filter ansari-whatsapp lint`. Phase 6 widens it to the root `pnpm test && pnpm typecheck && pnpm lint`. Each phase is one commit prefixed `[Spec 358][Phase: ...]`, adding files by explicit path (never `git add -A`).

**Test discipline (from the repo's lessons):** every new test must be shown able to fail by temporarily breaking the code it covers, then restoring it. The Python mapping is recorded per phase.

**Comment discipline (success criterion):** carry over the Python docstrings and comments, with Meta reference URLs, as TSDoc (`/** ... */`). Every setting in `.env.example` and in the config module documents purpose, allowed values, default and which environments use it.

## Phase Breakdown

### Phase 1: Scaffold apps/whatsapp, config, masked logging

**Dependencies**: None

**Objective**: A buildable, testable empty app that loads and validates configuration and logs safely.

**Files to create** (modelled on `apps/auth`): `package.json` (name `ansari-whatsapp`, `"type": "module"`, same scripts), `tsconfig.json`, `eslint.config.mjs`, `vitest.config.ts`, `tsdown.config.ts`, `.env.example`, `.env.ci`, `src/config.ts`, `src/logger.ts`, `src/logMasking.ts`, `src/errors.ts`, `tests/config.test.ts`, `tests/logMasking.test.ts`.

**Behaviour to port**: every setting of `utils/config.py` (same names, so Railway variables carry over unchanged): `BACKEND_SERVER_URL`, `AUTH_SERVER_URL`, `AUTH_WHATSAPP_API_KEY`, `META_API_VERSION`, `META_BUSINESS_PHONE_NUMBER_ID`, `META_ACCESS_TOKEN_FROM_SYS_USER`, `META_WEBHOOK_VERIFY_TOKEN`, `META_ANSARI_APP_SECRET` (no default, on purpose), `META_REPLY_BY_PHONE`, `DEPLOYMENT_TYPE` (local, development, staging, production), `ALWAYS_RETURN_OK_TO_META`, `ORIGINS` (CORS), `WA_MAINTENANCE_MODE`, `WHATSAPP_CHAT_RETENTION_HOURS`, `WHATSAPP_MESSAGE_AGE_THRESHOLD_SECONDS`, `LOGGING_LEVEL`, `SENTRY_DSN`, and the mock flags `MOCK_ANSARI_CLIENT`, `MOCK_AUTH_CLIENT`, `MOCK_AUTH_TOKEN`, `MOCK_META_API`. Secrets are held so they never print (the counterpart of Pydantic's `SecretStr`). Switches accept the same spellings as apps/api's `MAINTENANCE_MODE` (`true`, `false`, `True`, `False`, `1`, `0`; owner decision) and refuse anything else, so `yes`, `on` and `TRUE`, which Pydantic accepted, now stop start-up; phase 7 checks the Railway values. The entry points are named like apps/api's (`getEnv`, `resetEnvCache`, type `Env`), with `buildConfig(env)` added so tests pass an object instead of patching `process.env`. **`LOG_TEST_FILES_ONLY` is deliberately not ported** (owner decision): in Python it silenced every log line not coming from a test file, which was only a way to quiet the test output; the Node test runner already hides logs from passing tests, and Node cannot cheaply see the calling file. **`META_WEBHOOK_ZROK_SHARE_TOKEN` is deliberately not ported** (owner decision): in Python it is read only by `config.py`, to add `<token>.share.zrok.io` to the CORS allow-list in local mode, and Meta's server-to-server webhooks send no `Origin` header, so that entry has no functional effect. Its setup notes (the zrok reserve/release steps and callback-URL explanation) move into `.env.example` as commented-out information so local developers keep them. The rule that `META_REPLY_BY_PHONE` is off by default and refused when `DEPLOYMENT_TYPE` is production; `utils/log_masking.py` and `app_logger.py` (per-environment detail: local full, staging masked, production keys only; request ID and user ID on every line).

**Python tests mapped**: `test_environment_behaviour.py`, `test_railway_logging.py`, part of `test_meta_sender_logging.py`.

**Done when**: green command passes; `.env.example` documents every setting; a negative control proves the production refusal and the masking tests can fail.

### Phase 2: Pure logic

**Dependencies**: Phase 1

**Objective**: The side-effect-free pieces, easiest to verify against Python.

**Files**: `src/formatting/whatsappMessageFormatter.ts`, `src/formatting/messageSplitter.ts`, `src/webhook/parseWebhook.ts` (Zod schema plus extraction; reads `from` only when `META_REPLY_BY_PHONE` is on, read at call time, not at import), `src/utils/language.ts`, `src/utils/time.ts` and matching tests.

**Python tests mapped**: `test_message_splitter.py`, formatter and webhook-parser cases in `test_whatsapp_service.py`, `test_meta_sender_logging.py`.

**Done when**: all mapped cases pass with identical expected strings, including the 4000-character split, RTL handling, status/wrong-number/unsupported/stale webhook classification.

### Phase 3: Service clients

**Dependencies**: Phase 2

**Objective**: The three outbound clients, each behind an interface with a real and a mock implementation.

**Files**: `src/services/authClient.ts` (`POST /api/whatsapp/session`, per-BSUID token cache for a little under 15 minutes, the 400/401/403/429+`X-Retry-After`/500 handling and per-user cool-down from spec 321), `src/services/ansariClient.ts` (streaming chat endpoints, trailing `Error:` detection after HTTP 200, 401 then one re-exchange and one retry), `src/services/metaApiService.ts` (typing indicator, send; `reply_to` BSUID or phone), mocks, tests using a local fake HTTP server or injected `fetch`.

**Python tests mapped**: `test_auth_statuses.py`, `test_bsuid_auth_flow.py`, client parts of `test_thread_lifecycle.py`.

**Done when**: the status table in spec 321 is fully covered, including: no phone number ever in an `apps/auth` or `apps/api` request body or log; a second 401 ends with the right Sentry event name.

### Phase 4: Conversation manager

**Dependencies**: Phase 3

**Objective**: The orchestration: user registration via token exchange, the thread lifecycle (one thread per user, 3-hour expiry), maintenance mode (`WA_MAINTENANCE_MODE`), the staging `!d ` prefix filter, message-age check, notices.

**Files**: `src/conversationManager.ts`, `tests/conversationManager.test.ts`.

**Python tests mapped**: `test_thread_lifecycle.py`, orchestration parts of `test_whatsapp_service.py`, `test_bsuid_auth_flow.py`.

**Done when**: all Python lifecycle and notice scenarios pass; negative controls for expiry, maintenance and the `!d ` filter.

### Phase 5: HTTP app

**Dependencies**: Phase 4

**Objective**: The Express app and server entry.

**Files**: `src/app.ts` (`buildApp(deps)`), `src/index.ts`, `tests/app.test.ts`. Routes: `GET /` health, `GET /whatsapp/v3` verification handshake, `POST /whatsapp/v3`. The signature check needs the raw request bytes, so the JSON body parser must keep them (Express `express.json({ verify })`) and the HMAC-SHA256 comparison must be constant-time (`crypto.timingSafeEqual`). The handler responds 200, then runs processing un-awaited with a top-level catch. Request-ID middleware; `ALWAYS_RETURN_OK_TO_META` behaviour preserved, including the unsupported-message path (error code `UNSUPPORTED_MESSAGE_TYPE`, status 415 when the flag is off); CORS from `ORIGINS`; the verification handshake compares tokens in constant time like `hmac.compare_digest`; graceful shutdown; binds `PORT` (default **3200** for local runs; Railway injects its own `PORT`). Express has no default port (8001 was a choice in the Python service, not a FastAPI rule; 8000 is only uvicorn's default). 3000 is `apps/api`, 3100 is `apps/auth`, and nothing in the repo uses 3200, so the next free number in the same series is used. The local zrok command changes from `localhost:8001` to `localhost:3200`.

**Note on `scripts/check_meta_subscriptions.py`** (644 lines, an operator tool, not part of the service): it is ported separately, in phase 7.

**Python tests mapped**: `test_whatsapp_service.py`, `test_utils.py`.

**Done when**: acknowledgment timing is tested independently of background work (the 200 is observed before a deliberately slow mock finishes); invalid or missing signature rejected; handshake passes and fails correctly.

### Phase 6: Docker, Railway config, CI, turbo and documentation

**Dependencies**: Phase 5

**Objective**: Make the app shippable by the repo's tooling.

**Files**: `apps/whatsapp/Dockerfile` (same shape as `apps/auth/Dockerfile`), `apps/whatsapp/railway.toml` (health check `/`; the same "record, not read by Railway" header as the legacy file), `apps/whatsapp/README.md`, root `turbo.json` `globalEnv` additions for the new variables (the file explains why every variable must be listed), a CI job for the new app, and the architecture notes under `codev/resources/`.

**Done when**: root green command passes from a cold cache (`--force`); Docker image builds locally if Docker is available (otherwise recorded as **not verified**, never as passed).

### Phase 7: Operator script port, staging redeploy, smoke test and legacy rollback note

**Dependencies**: Phase 6

**Why the script is here and not its own phase:** porch fixes the list of plan phases when the plan is approved, so a new numbered phase would need a rollback to the plan phase and a second approval. The script is first in this phase, because the staging steps below use it.

**Part A: port `legacy/whatsapp/scripts/check_meta_subscriptions.py`** (644 lines, an interactive operator tool) to `apps/whatsapp/scripts/checkMetaSubscriptions.ts`. It inspects the Meta Messaging account (WABA): its details, the apps subscribed to it, its phone numbers and the access token's app and expiry, and can subscribe or unsubscribe the app the token belongs to. A webhook only reaches the Meta apps subscribed to the account, so it is the tool for "messages to the staging number do not arrive".
- Same menu, same explanatory text (the prerequisite-knowledge section and the WABA/app/token relations), same confirmations before the two changing actions (POST and DELETE on `subscribed_apps`), same fallback to prompting when `.env` has no token or account id.
- Counterparts: `requests` becomes the built-in `fetch`; `input()` and `getpass` become `node:readline/promises` (the token prompt hides what is typed); `load_dotenv` becomes `dotenv`. Reads `META_ACCESS_TOKEN_FROM_SYS_USER`, `META_MESSAGING_ACCOUNT_ID` and `META_API_VERSION` (Python hard-coded `v26.0`; same default here). Run with `pnpm --filter ansari-whatsapp meta:subscriptions`.
- The Python script has no tests. The TypeScript one gets tests for its pure parts with an injected `fetch`: how each Meta response is read, that only the token's own app is ever unsubscribed, and that the token is never printed. Each is shown able to fail.
- `.env.example`: the commented `META_MESSAGING_ACCOUNT_ID` and `META_ANSARI_APP_ID` entries now say this script reads them.
- **Verified** only against mocked responses. Live checks (read-only options) run against staging in Part B. The two changing actions are not run without the owner's go-ahead.

**Part B: staging.** Replace the Python build on the existing Railway staging `whatsapp` service. No production change.

**Steps**:
1. Compare the staging service's variables with `.env.example` (names only; never print values or the token `ASH_RAILWAY_PAT`). Also check that every True/False variable uses `true`, `false`, `True`, `False`, `1` or `0`: the TypeScript service refuses `yes`, `on` and `TRUE`, which the Python service accepted.
2. Point the staging `whatsapp` service at `apps/whatsapp/Dockerfile` and redeploy. **Done by the user or with the user's explicit go-ahead**, because it changes a shared service.
3. Smoke test: visible-phone user, hidden-phone (BSUID-only) user, a long answer, and error paths (maintenance mode, `apps/auth` refusal).
3a. Change the webhook callback URL in the staging Meta app's webhook settings from `.../whatsapp/v2` to `.../whatsapp/v3` (owner-made change in Meta's dashboard; re-run the verification handshake and confirm Meta shows the subscription as active). Until this is done, Meta still posts to `/v2`, which the TypeScript service does not serve.
4. Add a brief rollback note to `legacy/whatsapp/README.md` (rolling back also means setting Meta's callback URL back to `/whatsapp/v2`): the Python image and Dockerfile are unchanged, so rollback is repointing the staging service at `legacy/whatsapp/Dockerfile` and redeploying.

**Done when**: smoke results are listed in the review as verified or not, with evidence.

## Risks and Mitigation

| Risk | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| Acknowledgment delayed by processing | Phase 5 timing test |
| Types give false confidence about Meta JSON | Zod parsing at every boundary (phases 2, 3) |
| Streaming aggregation differs from Python | Chunk-boundary and trailing-error tests (phase 3) |
| Formatter output drifts | Port Python expectations verbatim before refactoring (phase 2) |
| Un-awaited background Promise fails silently | Single wrapper with catch, log and Sentry; test that a failure is reported (phase 5) |
| Windows test flakiness (CRLF fixtures, POSIX paths) | No fixture files read from disk; paths built with `node:path` |

## Self-review (agent, no external consultation)

The owner chose agent self-review followed by owner review; Codex and Gemini are not installed and the Claude consult hung. Checked against the Python source:

- **Fixed:** the plan omitted the CORS `ORIGINS` setting, the four mock flags, the 415 unsupported-message reply, and the default port (now 3200, not Python's 8001).
- **Decided:** `META_WEBHOOK_ZROK_SHARE_TOKEN` is not ported; its notes live in `.env.example` as comments. Verified by search: the only code reading it is `config.py`; the other mentions are docs, `.env.example`, the README and printed hints in `check_meta_subscriptions.py`. Not verified live: that Meta never sends an `Origin` header (inferred from webhooks being server-to-server and from the code only checking `Origin`).
- **Fixed:** settings must keep their Python names so Railway staging needs no variable changes.
- **Verified:** route list (`GET /`, `GET /whatsapp/v2`, `POST /whatsapp/v2`) and the constant-time token and signature comparison match `main.py`. The TypeScript service deliberately renames the two webhook routes to `/whatsapp/v3` (owner decision), so the port is not byte-for-byte identical there.
- **Changed after owner review of phase 1:** booleans use apps/api's six spellings; `getEnv`, `resetEnvCache` and `Env` replace `getConfig`, `resetConfigCache` and `Config`; `LOG_TEST_FILES_ONLY` is dropped; the Meta script is ported in phase 7.
- **Not verified:** exact Markdown formatter output and splitter edge cases are only confirmed once the Python tests are ported (phase 2).
- **Not verified:** whether `apps/auth`'s tsconfig and eslint presets apply unchanged to a second Express app; phase 1 finds out.

## Open items for the owner

- Confirm the directory name `apps/whatsapp` (the spec said "likely").
- Staging variable changes and the Railway repoint in phase 7 need the owner's go-ahead at that time.
